Release Notes for CernVM-FS 2.12.0
==================================

CernVM-FS 2.12.0 is a sizeable feature release with new features, bug fixes and performance improvements.
NOTE: Testing has shown instances of cache corruption with this release, it will not be released in production. On your testing instances, upgrade to 2.12.2, run ``cvmfs_config fsck -q`` frequently and report any errors. 

Highlights are:

* Experimental Support for FUSE-T on MacOS, allowing for easy installation without security tweaks. NOTE: There are some known issues with FUSE-T, do not expext this to be stable yet.

* Refcounted Cache Manager now the default

* Fully-featured Streaming Cache Manager for data / files that should not be cached

* Support for Metalink server discovery

* Several fixes in the fuse internals, for example the page cache tracker

* Reloading of CVMFS after package upgrades is now done via a daemon to avoid blocking the package transaction


As with previous releases, upgrading clients should be seamless just by
installing the new package from the repository. As usual, we recommend updating only a few worker nodes first and gradually ramp up once the new version proves
to work correctly. Please take special care when upgrading a cvmfs client in NFS mode.

For Stratum 1 servers, there should be no running snapshots during the upgrade.
For publisher and gateway nodes, all transactions must be closed; no active leases must be present before upgrading.

Packages are available for both the x86_64 and aarch64 architectures, for current debian- and rhel-based distros.
